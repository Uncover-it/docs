# Uncover it Developer Documentation

Uncover it is aimed to be a **malware configuration extraction service**. We add new detections for malicious malware families and statically extract them (although dynamic is planned too).

Currently, we support more than **one hundred** families for backdoors / botnets / crypters / stealers etc.
