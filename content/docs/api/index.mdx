# Getting Started

To begin with, you will require an [api key](https://www.uncoverit.org/).

Uncover it provides 3 public tiers along with special plans for those who need more requests

<Tabs items={['Tier 1', 'Tier 2', 'Tier 3', 'Enterprise']}>
  <Tab value="Tier 1">150 Requests ~ 75 Files</Tab>
  <Tab value="Tier 2">300 Requests ~ 150 Files</Tab>
  <Tab value="Tier 3">1000 Requests ~ 500 Files</Tab>
  <Tab value="Enterprise">Custom as required</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warn">
    Note that Uncover it does not provide API access for free
</Callout>

Since each file upload takes one request and each report fetch takes one request, if used correctly the API will only use 2 requests per file.

The API key will **automatically expire after one month of purchase unless renewed within time**. You will need to buy a fresh one to keep using our service.

# Usage

## Limits

Uncover it currently **only** support files that are:
- .exe, .elf or .bin
- Under 100MiB

## Using a package (recommended)

All packages come with type-safety, automatic caching, error handelling and will make sure you don't accidently lose out on precious usage

## Manual

Manually make connections with the API. Ensure memoization rules are in place properly so you don't waste requests and don't be shy to reach out if you need any help
